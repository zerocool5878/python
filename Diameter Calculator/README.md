This script was written for the purpose of mesuring the diameter from motorcycle handlebars without removing the grips.

The only measurment you need is the circumference which you can get from wrapping a piece of string around the bars and then measuring the string.

This you will enter in the script when it asks for it.


Once the script is running it will first ask you if you would like to calculate the diameter or the radius. type d or r

Then you will enter your circumference measurement.

Next it will ask for the accuracy in which you wish to calculate. Such as to the nearest 1/8th or 16th etc. For this type 8 for the nearest 1/8 and so on 

I am sure this could be used for something else I am just not sure what :)


Enjoy!
